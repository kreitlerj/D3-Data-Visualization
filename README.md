# D3-Data-Visualization

This project is a representation of how to use D3 to visualize data in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  Using U.S. Census Data, a fake webpage was set up to visualize a scatter plot of Poverty Rate vs. Healthcare.  You will also need Python install so a simple http server can be set up to view the page.  The reason for this is because the page is trying to grab a file from an http//: or https//: path while the JavaScript is loading from a file//: path.  Just follow the instructions on this [Website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server) to create a local server using Python.

### Steps to Open
1. Download the files.
2. Open the command prompt (Windows)/ terminal (macOS/ Linux).
3. Access the directory where the files were downloaded.
4. Start the local web server.
5. Open the browser.
6. Type in the address "localhost:8000"
